Sagotsky's dotfiles and scripts.  

I link to these things often enough that they might as well be on github.  Also, I'm hopeful that publicizing my scripts will force me to write them properly, even if nobody actively uses or reviews them.

= Scripts =

Whole lot of scripts in here.  Some will eventually be extracted into their own repos.  For now, here's an explanation of the interesting ones.  No point listing the one-offs.

== 4E2latex.pl ==

Generates latex documents from text files with Dungeons & Dragons 4th ed NPC stat blocks.  See: ddi-mooch.  Highlighting is based on my vim syntax highlighter for this, but meant for a white background.

== active_win_man.sh ==

Calls up a manpage for currently focused window.  Meant for a keyboard shortcut.  Digs into terminal windows to find their shell and active program.  I mostly use this as an example for getting info about a window.

== ddi-mooch.sh ==

Downloads plain text copies of all content in D&D 4e's compendium.  Needs a cookies.txt file with authorization to connect to DDI comepndium.  Good example of using xargs for forking parallel processes.

== gdmSwitch.sh ==

Switches to another user's X session or to GDM's login screen if user isn't logged in.  This exists because my wife couldn't handle ctrl-alt-f8.  It would be a good example of esoteric GDM commands that are poorly documented, except that gdm3 deprected all those options.  

== notify-volume.sh ==

Watches mixer device for changes.  Spits out volume after each change.  Used by xmobar instead of polling 1/sec for current volume.

== plbroadcatch ==

Todo: make separate repo, rewrite.  This script connects to showrss and downloads my new TV torrents.  It's in perl so I could run it on my dd-wrt router.  (It had been in python, but I didn't have the disk space to install python there.)  It's also my first perl project, so don't use it as an example.
